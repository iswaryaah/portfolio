# Iswaryaah Balakrishnan's Portfolio
Here are the projects that I have worked on... 

# Project 1: SQL Queries â†’ [Assignment 1 SQL.docx](https://github.com/iswaryaah/portfolio/files/9576586/Assignment.1.SQL.docx)

* Created a database in SQLite Studio.
* Applied basic data querying techniques to create datasets from database tables.

# How is SQL used in Data Science? 
* Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. 
* It is used to update/create/delete databases, execute queries, and manage data access permissions.
* Many organizations store data in relational databases thus a data scientist should know how to use SQL in order to retrieve and manipulate data.
* Data can be retrieved from a database using SQL and can then be further analyzed using R, Python, or other tools.
