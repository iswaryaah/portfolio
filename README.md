# ![Project 1 - SQL](https://github.com/iswaryaah/portfolio/blob/main/project%20files/Assignment%201%20SQL.docx)

* Created a database in SQLite Studio.
* Applied basic data querying techniques to create datasets from database tables.

# How is SQL used in Data Science? 
* Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. 
* It is used to update/create/delete databases, execute queries, and manage data access permissions.
* Many organizations store data in relational databases thus a data scientist should know how to use SQL in order to retrieve and manipulate data.
* Data can be retrieved from a database using SQL and can then be further analyzed using R, Python, or other tools.

# Basic SQL syntax
• SELECT
• DISTINCT
• WHERE
• INSERT
• ORDER BY
• GROUP BY
• Joins
• Unions
• Sub-queries

# ![Project 2 - Basic Python](https://github.com/iswaryaah/portfolio/blob/main/project%20files/Assignment%202.ipynb)

* Wrote simple Python functions
* Worked with strings and dictionaries

# Working with Python
* I installed Anaconda and programmed in Jupyter. 
* Anaconda allows us to create multiple environments, manage Python packages in various versions (when working on
multiple projects) and provides access to multiple IDEs.

# Project 3
* Created Numpy arrays and performed basic arithmetic functions
* Interpreted and applied library documentation
