# Iswaryaah Balakrishnan's Portfolio
Here are the assignments and projects that I have worked on...

# ![Project 1 - SQL](https://github.com/iswaryaah/portfolio/blob/main/project%20files/Assignment%201%20SQL.docx)

* Created a database in SQLite Studio.
* Applied basic data querying techniques to create datasets from database tables.

# How is SQL used in Data Science? 
* Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. 
* It is used to update/create/delete databases, execute queries, and manage data access permissions.
* Many organizations store data in relational databases thus a data scientist should know how to use SQL in order to retrieve and manipulate data.
* Data can be retrieved from a database using SQL and can then be further analyzed using R, Python, or other tools.

# Basic SQL syntax
• SELECT
• DISTINCT
• WHERE
• INSERT
• ORDER BY
• GROUP BY
• Joins
• Unions
• Sub-queries

# ![Project 2 - Basic Python](https://github.com/iswaryaah/portfolio/blob/main/project%20files/Assignment%202.ipynb)

* Wrote simple Python functions
* Worked with strings and dictionaries

# Working with Python
* I installed Anaconda and programmed in Jupyter. 
* Anaconda allows us to create multiple environments, manage Python packages in various versions (when working on
multiple projects) and provides access to multiple IDEs.

# ![Project 3 - Data Analysis using Python](https://github.com/iswaryaah/portfolio/blob/main/project%20files/Assignment%203.ipynb)

* In this project, I analyzed data of the passengers aboard the titanic.

# My data analysis approach
* I imported the titanic dataset and then I used .info() to get a summary of the dataframe. 
* The .info function lists all the columns along with their data types.
* I can also interpret which columns have missing data. 
* I then used the .head() function to see what the dataset looks like. 
* To analyse data, I used the groupby() function to categorize my data.
* I used the groupby function to specify the columns to group on and then the columns to aggregate.

* Throughout the analysis, I anchored to the key question of who would be more likely to survive.
* I used functions such as...
  ► pandas.cut() to categorise age
  ► .median() to find the median fare paid by passengers 
  ► .mean() to find the average age of passengers
